# FaceOut2.0
Privacy and Security are two universal rights and, to ensure that in our daily life we are secure, a lot of
research is going on in the field of home security, and IoT is the turning point for the industry, where we 
connect everyday objects to share data for our betterment. Facial recognition is a well-established process in
which the face is detected and identified out of the image. We aim to create a smart door, which secures the gateway on
the basis of who we are. In our proof of concept of a smart door we have used a live camera on the front side of
setup attached to a display monitor connected with the camera to show who is standing in front of the door, 
also the whole system will be able to give text outputs by processing the image then the Computer System is
used to show the answers as output on the screen. We are using an electronic lock controlled by a microcontroller, 
which will act as an output interface. So a person can open the smart door with the help of facial recognition and 
at the same time also be able to interact with it. The facial recognition is done by Kairos face API but our state 
of the art desktop application operating over PyCharm IDE that reduces the computational time by detecting the face 
out of photo and giving that as the input to Kairos Face API, which is hosted over Kairos cloud support.
On the basis output received from Kairos API various operations will be performed and decisions will be taken accordingly.
